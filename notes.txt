Add a directory of levels that contain the configuration for each level
e.g. object placement, number of tiles

Create a level manager that is running and can load int the next level
The level manager can return the obstacle locations for the level to help with colisions

Create a super class for objects
size, can stop player, can hurt player, can move

Create different types of object
block, platform, moving platform, spike

To help build the levels - add logs that let me use level creator to log x:y when a tile is placed


BUG: Need to fine tune the right side collision as for some reason hits ceiling is logged when falling down right wall

Expose the variables in the browser and tweak them on the fly to find the perfect setting - DONE!

stand still jump should be lower than running jump add a jump scaling factor that increases with speed (or use current speed!)
